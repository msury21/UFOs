# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a table of UFO sightings that are able to be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
When using the site, the filtering search bars are already primed with example searches.

Simply type one (or many) criteria in, and the table will be filtered to match what was entered.

A very easy-to-use function that will give website visitors a great opportunity to find exactly the kind of UFO data they require.

## Summary
While this function allows great searchability, it does not allow the user to filter based only on the data that exists. For example, if I search for a UFO sighting on 1/11/2020, I am met with no data - and that's with only one search term.

One feature I would recommend would be the ability to have a drop down filter on the table itself, which allows the user to see what exactly is actually in the table. Another thought would to be to add a filter on duration (which would function more like a slider/bucket), allowing a user to search for UFOs that were seconds-long blurs in the sky or hovering for several minutes.
